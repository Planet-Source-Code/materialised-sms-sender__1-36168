### Description

This code sends messages of 160 Characters to SMS Compatable mobile phones. Apparently it supports over 175 countries, however I cant vouch for this as I only tested on british numbers, the program needs you to have a vaild SMSX username and password (Free of Course) and you can sign up from within the program. This program is the basis of a .ocx I am developing to utalise all the xml/soap SMS functions from http://www.soapengine.com/lucin/soapenginex/smsx.asmx If you like this code please vote for it. It isnt very well commented I am afraid as it was only a test for personal reasons. Tip:- If you change the Flash Setting to 1, it will automatically open up on the recipients handset, not giving them the option to read or not.
